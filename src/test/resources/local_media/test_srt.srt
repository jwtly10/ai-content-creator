THAT MOMENT HE WAS 

55
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:54,900
GOING TO PROPOSE 

56
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,110
I LOOK TO SEE 

57
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,410
WHERE 

58
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,420
LUCAS WAS AND HE 

59
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,390
WAS HOLDING RED AND 

60
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,730
WHITE ROSES WALKING OUT 

61
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,600

62
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:00,730

00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,210
CHLOE 

64
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,489
JACOB’S GIRLFRIEND SPELLING OUT

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,069
WILL YOU MARRY ME 

66
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:06,159
I WAS SHOCKED THAT 

67
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,049
THEY WENT BEHIND MY 

68
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:07,530
BACK WHEN 

69
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,290
I SAID NO 

70
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:09,590
I GOT UP OUT 

71
00:01:09,589 --> 00:01:10,530

00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:12,990
SINCE THE WEDDING AND 

75
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,170
MY HUSBAND CURSED ME 

76
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,120

77
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,960

78
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,390

79
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,030
I RESPONDED WITH 

80
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,220
I WANTED THE DAY 

81
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:19,970
TO BE ABOUT US 

82
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,649
OUR WEDDING NOT THEIRS 

83
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:21,839

84
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,589
I AM HAPPY FOR 

85
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,470
THEM BUT THE WORST 

86
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,430
THING WAS EVEN THOUGH 

87
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:25,229
I SAID NO YOU 

88
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,240

89
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:26,699
ABOUT IT 

90
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,179
SINCE THAT ARGUMENT HE 

91
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:28,899
MOVED TO THE GUEST 

92
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,179
BEDROOM AND NOW MOST 

93
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,020

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,960
